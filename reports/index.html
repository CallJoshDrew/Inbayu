                    My first impression of Kapalai was its immense beauty, with the resort built entirely on stilts in the middle of the sea. The water houses and the vastness of the surrounding ocean create a stunning natural setting. The resort is huge with many rooms, but I never felt crowded, even though it was fully booked. The only time I saw a lot of tourists was during meal times.

                    The resort and its facilities are very clean and well-maintained. There were no broken or faulty areas. I am staying at the room A2 which is the standard room. The room design is what I would consider normal, which is to be expected since the resort has been in operation for over 30 years and is not modern. The air conditioning was not very strong, but the ceiling fan helped. The sound of the waves at night was like music to my ears, which was incredibly relaxing and helped me fall asleep quickly. The public areas are designed to be relaxing, and I particularly enjoyed the sand area, which gave me the feeling of being at the beach despite being in the middle of the sea.

                    While Kapalai is a world-renowned diving spot, most of the tourists I saw were families on holiday, not divers. The resort offers the option for island hopping. There are no swimming pools or specific facilities for children.

                    The services were good, and the staff's attitude was excellent. Upon arrival, a welcome drink and a warm "Welcome to Kapalai" greeting were offered, which made me feel very welcome. Everyone I encountered smiled and greeted me.

                    The resort also offers both sunrise and sunset views. The scenery was nice and beautiful, with many different settings to allow tourists to take photos. The sunset and sunrise were not very convenient to get to, as I had to walk a distance to reach the designated areas, depending on where my room was located.

                    My first impression was that Pearl Island has a better view than Kapalai, offering a combination of mountains and sea. The resort is built next to a national park, giving a "you paid for one but get two" feeling. The dining room's design is a big highlight for me. It's a large, open-air circle that is very transparent and windy, making me feel closer to nature and surrounded by it while having my meals. There are also many beautiful settings, like swing chairs and "love icons," perfect for taking pictures.

                    The rooms are more modern than those at Kapalai. They are unique, with a good interior design and a hot tub in each room. The balcony offers a direct view of both the sea and the mountain, and I enjoyed lying there, taking in the beautiful scenery and the calm wind. The cleanliness and maintenance of the resort were excellent, with no issues.

                    I found the snorkeling and kayaking to be very enjoyable. The kayaking was particularly spacious compared to Kapalai, with a very big area to do the activity. While there's a hiking option, I was unable to go because there were no other tourists interested in hiking that day. The resort also offers island hopping.

                In conclusion, both resorts offer unique experiences. However, as a non-diver, I found myself preferring Pearl Island over Kapalai. The modern and unique design of Pearl Island's dining hall was a major highlight, as it made me feel completely surrounded by nature. This feeling of being one with the natural environment—whether I was walking, dining, or even bathing—was incredibly refreshing and relaxing.
